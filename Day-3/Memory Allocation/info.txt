Generally we can allocate memory for a program in two ways
--> At Compile Time
--> At Run Time

Suppose if you are allocated memory at compile Time of a program is called Static Memory Allocation
This memory is of fixed size

Suppose if you are allocated Memory at run time of a progam is called Dynamic memory alloaction (DMA)
and the memory is of variable size

In c programming for allocating and DeAllocating Memory we will use the following functins

1) malloc()     }\   
2) calloc()     } |=>  Memory allocation
3) realloc()    }/
4) free()       } => Memory DeAllocation


## malloc()
    -> Purpose: Allocate a single block of memory Dynamically
    ->Synatx:   ptr=(int*)malloc(20);
                ptr(int *)malloc(n*sizeof(int));
    /a) Memory is created successfully, It retuns first byte address.
    \b) Memory is Not created successfully, It retuns Null Pointer.

    It returns a void pointer, So type casting is Mandatory.
